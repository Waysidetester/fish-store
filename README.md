# Fish Store

I made an entirely underwhelming fish store.
Users will be able to:
  - See all the fish that are available in the store.
  - Apply a filter to see only the fish that are on sale.
  - Add fish to their basket
  - Remove fish from their basket.
  
 First [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) implementation for all of the DOM interaction.

## To View

1. Clone repository to local machine.
1. Using http-server (`$ npm install http-server`) feed project to the port 8888 (`-p 8888`)
1. open localhost:8888 in your browser's address bar

## Notes
* This is not a high quality code for a user cart. There are a few hard coded set methods that would be unportable for multiple cart items
* Styling is minimal due to simple project specifications
